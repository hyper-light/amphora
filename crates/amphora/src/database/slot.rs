//! before it (`replication::on_base`), and a follower's reaches the leader's log a ReadIndex round,
//! its preparation and a forward after the leader's own would: under steady leader writes it is
//! refused round after round. Once one of a member's writes is refused at the leader's append,

//! that never comes back never holds the leader. A pure core: the owner tells it what the leader
