# Status

Updated 2026-10-20. A piece is done when its tests pass in the gate (`scripts/gates.sh`: Linux, with the
macOS and Windows lints) and the evidence its requirement names is recorded.

## Implemented

- **The bar** (kiln's CP-M1): a Cargo workspace whose lints deny panics, this repository's rules
  (`CLAUDE.md`), the requirement registry (`docs/requirements.toml`), the design's starting point
  (`docs/design/README.md`), the gate (`scripts/gates.sh`, run by kiln CI from `.kiln/ci.yaml`), and the
  vendoring tool (`scripts/vendor.py`, kiln's).
- **The `amphora` binary** says what it is (`amphora --version`, `amphora --help`), and nothing more yet.

## Next

- **CP-T1.1**: Turso and the K0 benchmark move here from kiln; Amphora's first engine layer on Turso (adaptive group commit, readers on WAL snapshots, typed back-pressure) replaces the one writer thread of kiln's conversation store.
- **CP-T1.2**: Baselines on a quiet machine against SQLite, Postgres 17, Vitess, CockroachDB and TiDB; the research; the client protocol; `docs/design/` written to it.
- **CP-T1.3**: Turso's MVCC with `BEGIN CONCURRENT` made serializable and production-grade, and the engine multi-writer on it.

## Open

Everything else the track's plan names (kiln plan `01a157fdefba746a94a5fcd920a80d5a`): each goal, its criteria and how each is
measured are in `docs/requirements.toml`.
